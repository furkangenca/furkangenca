#  Furkan Genca | Software Engineer

##  About Me
I enjoy designing and building software from the ground up—taking an idea and turning it into a structured, working product.  
The process of organizing, shaping, and refining something that didn't exist before is what makes development meaningful to me.

I'm open to opportunities where I can learn, contribute, and grow by building useful, well-crafted software.
